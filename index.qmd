## Welcome to MA206X

This website contains interactive lesson materials for MA206X: Introduction to Probability and Statistics, following Devore's 9th Edition of *Probability and Statistics for Engineering and the Sciences*.

### Course Overview

This course introduces you to the foundational principles of probability and statistics, emphasizing data literacy and inference. The course is organized into three blocks:

#### Block I: Data and Randomness

- Understanding data types and study design
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization
- Probability theory and counting principles
- Discrete and continuous probability distributions

#### Block II: Inference

- Central Limit Theorem and sampling distributions
- Confidence intervals for means and proportions
- Hypothesis testing (one-sample and two-sample)
- Type I/II errors and statistical power

#### Block III: Regression Modeling

- Simple and multiple linear regression
- ANOVA and experimental design
- Model diagnostics and interpretation
- Real-world applications with Army data

### The Six Step Method

Every statistical analysis in this course follows a clear, repeatable process:

1. **Ask a research question** - Formulate a meaningful, testable question
2. **Design a study and collect data** - Choose appropriate sampling methods
3. **Explore the data** - Use visualizations and summary statistics
4. **Draw inferences beyond the data** - Apply statistical tests and models
5. **Formulate conclusions** - Interpret results in context
6. **Look back and ahead** - Reflect on limitations and future directions

### Technology: R Programming

Throughout this course, we'll use **R** for data analysis. The primary focus is not on becoming coding experts, but on using R as a tool to:

- Summarize and visualize data effectively
- Perform statistical tests and create models
- Communicate findings clearly and reproducibly

Building on skills from CY105, you'll develop practical data analysis capabilities that support your understanding of statistical concepts.
